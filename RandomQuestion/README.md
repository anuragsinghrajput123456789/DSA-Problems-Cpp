Introduction
This repository serves as a collection of various DSA problems. The goal is to practice different problem-solving techniques and algorithms while learning new data structures. Solutions provided are efficient, optimized, and include thorough explanations.

Problem Categories
The problems in this repository are categorized based on the type of data structure or algorithm used to solve them. Below are the key categories:

Arrays: Problems involving arrays, such as sorting, searching, etc.
Linked List: Problems related to singly and doubly linked lists, as well as operations like reversal, merging, etc.
Stack: Solutions using stack data structure for problems like balancing parentheses, expression evaluation, etc.
Queue: Problems where queue data structure is used, such as implementing a circular queue, BFS, etc.
Trees: Problems on various tree structures like binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and tree traversals.
Graph: Graph traversal algorithms like BFS, DFS, shortest path, etc.
Dynamic Programming: DP problems and solutions, focusing on optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
Greedy Algorithms: Problems solved using greedy approaches, including tasks like interval scheduling, coin change, etc.
Backtracking: Problems that use backtracking techniques, such as N-Queens, Sudoku solver, etc.
Bit Manipulation: Algorithms using bitwise operations for tasks like finding missing numbers, setting/unsetting bits, etc.
Solution Approach
Each problem is approached systematically:

Understand the Problem: Break down the problem statement and constraints.
Plan the Solution: Choose the right algorithm or data structure based on the problem type.
Optimize: Strive for optimal time and space complexity.
Test: Implement multiple test cases to validate correctness.
Document: Provide clear explanations of the approach and solution in the README for each problem.
