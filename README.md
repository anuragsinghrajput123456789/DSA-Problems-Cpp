DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Repository
This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. The goal is to practice and improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking. Each folder contains code in different programming languages for different data structures and algorithms.

Contents
Array: Implementations of common array algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, etc.).
Linked List: Problems and solutions related to singly and doubly linked lists.
Stack: Stack operations and problems.
Queue: Queue operations and problems.
Tree: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, etc.
Graph: Graph traversal, shortest path, etc.
Dynamic Programming: DP-based problems and solutions.
Greedy Algorithms: Problems that are solved using the greedy method.
Backtracking: Problems that involve searching solutions by backtracking.
Bit Manipulation: Solutions using bitwise operations.
Problem Solving Approach
Each problem is solved with a focus on optimal time and space complexity.
The problems range from basic to advanced, and solutions are written in multiple programming languages where applicable.
Languages Used
C++
Java
Python
JavaScript
(Feel free to add more languages you use in your solutions.)
